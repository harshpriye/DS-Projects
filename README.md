Machine Learning is a latest  **buzzword**  floating around. It deserves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.  
**What does Machine Learning really means?**  
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.  
**Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs**  that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.  
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.  **The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically**  without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

-   A churn with respect to the Telecom industry, is defined as the percentage of  **subscribers moving**  from a specific service to a service provider to another in a period of time.
-   Research shows that the companies have an  **average churn of 1.9 to 2 percent**  month on month and annualized churn ranging from 10 to 60 percent.
-   An effort to build a model which helps in reducing the churn rate for a telecom company.

-   Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for  **theft**  and  **fraud committed**  using or involving a payment card, such as credit or debit card, as  **fraudulent source**  of funds in a transaction.
-   The purpose may be to obtain goods without paying, or to obtain  **unauthorized funds from an account**.
-   Credit card fraud is also and adjunct to  **identity**  theft.
-   Building a robust model so that credit card companies are able to recognize the fraudulent card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

-   This is a beginner's example of  **document classification**  task which involves  **classifying**  an email as spam or not spam mail.
-   Spam box in your  **Gmail account**  is the best example of this.

-   Businesses that  **lack**  the monetary aspect, like  **viewership**,  **readership**, or  **surfing-oriented products**, could use  **Engagement parameters**  instead of Monetary factors.
-   The Engagement parameter could be defined as a composite value based on metrics such as  **bounce rate**,  **visit duration**,  **number of pages visted**,  **time spent per page**  etc.
-   RFM stand for  **Recency**,  **Frequency**  and  **Monetary**.
